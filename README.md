### About me :wave:
Hi, my name is Lighici Marian. Since the beginning of 2024, I've been diving deep into the world of QA, eager to make a positive impact on the digital landscape. With every course, self-study session, and hands-on project, I've honed my skills and developed a passion for ensuring quality in software products. As a junior QA tester, I'm excited to contribute my knowledge and enthusiasm to a team that shares my commitment to creating user-friendly and reliable applications. While I'm currently focusing on expanding my expertise in test automation, I'm always eager to learn new tools and techniques to enhance my QA capabilities.
